Actors:

Actors as objects which encapsulate state and behaviour, they communicated exclusively by exchanging messages which are
placed into the recipients mailbox.

An actor class is implemented by extending the AbstractActor class and setting the type of messages accepted and how to
process them.

Actor System:
Hierarchy of actors, manager supervising the child, passing on sub-task and handling failure.
On a failure case the supervisor has the following options:
1. Resume de subordinate, keeping its accumulated internal state
2. Restart the subordinate, clearing out its accumulated internal state
3. Stop the subordinate permanently
4. Escalate the failure, thereby failing itself
